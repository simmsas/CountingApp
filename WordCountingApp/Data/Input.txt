Write a C# console application which reads a text file as input and prints total
character and English word counts as output.

Let’s assume that code performance is *not* critical.

Application should also have a set of test suites written with chosen xUnit framework (preferably – NUnit)
for common values and edge cases. Visual Studio version, project type,
code formatting and casing style option have no constraints.
 
Good luck!
